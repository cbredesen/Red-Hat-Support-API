A note about Eclipse/m2eclpse

From http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/m2eclipse-faq.html#7

The project will not build straight away if imported into Eclpse via m2e.
You must either...

* Maven > Update Project Configuration
* configure m2eclpse to run the "process-resources" goal when importing

If done correctly, a second source folder will be present at 
target/generated-sources/xjc.
